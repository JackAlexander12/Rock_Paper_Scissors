# Rock_Paper_Scissors
I decided to start learning Python after Java since they are both languages which incorporate the use of Object-Oriented Programming.
This is the first of many python projects I plan to share.
I'm not sure if there is a way to add feedback but I am more than happy to receive any! You can find me on LinkedIn @ www.linkedin.com/in/jacka02 or you can email me at jack.alexander20202@gmail.com for questions or feedback. Thank you for reading
1. Essentially what I did was follow a youtube tutorial to create the initial Rock, Paper Scissors game. 
2. Then I decided that it would be a cool idea to add a win streak. I ran into a lot of issues and even had a lightbulb in the middle of a class and wrote down what I thought would work
It obviously didn't but it brought me closer to the current solution. One problem I ran into was having to leave one of the variables keeping track of the number of wins in a row set equal to 0 inside of the loop. Since, I'd been exhausted after the day, I couldn't quite think enough to realize an array would work just fine. Once I switched the variables around with an array, it worked perfectly! (I even did a little happy dance)
