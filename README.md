# Rock_Paper_Scissors
I decided to start learning Python after Java since they are both languages which incorporate the use of Object-Oriented Programming.
This is the first of many python projects I plan to share.

1. Essentially what I did was follow a youtube tutorial to create the initial Rock, Paper Scissors game. 
2. Then I decided that it would be a cool idea to add a win streak. I ran into a lot of issues and even had a lightbulb in the middle of a class and wrote down what I thought would work
It obviously didn't but it brought me closer to the current solution. Although not completely working at the moment, I have one more thing to fix (which is counting above two wins in a row).
